  <h1>Injection vulnerability</h1>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <div>
    Injection slides down to the third position. 94% of the applications were
    tested for some form of injection with a max incidence rate of 19%, an
    average incidence rate of 3%, and 274k occurrences. Notable Common Weakness
    Enumerations (CWEs) included are CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting, CWE-89: SQL
    Injection, and CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path.
  </div>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <div>
    <div>An application is vulnerable to attack when:</div>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the
          application.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context-aware
          escaping are used directly in the interpreter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hostile data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM) search
          parameters to extract additional, sensitive records.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hostile data is directly used or concatenated. The SQL or command
          contains the structure and malicious data in dynamic queries,
          commands, or stored procedures.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      Some of the more common injections are SQL, NoSQL, OS command, Object
      Relational Mapping (ORM), LDAP, and Expression Language (EL) or Object
      Graph Navigation Library (OGNL) injection. The concept is identical among
      all interpreters. Source code review is the best method of detecting if
      applications are vulnerable to injections. Automated testing of all
      parameters, headers, URL, cookies, JSON, SOAP, and XML data inputs is
      strongly encouraged. Organizations can include static (SAST), dynamic
      (DAST), and interactive (IAST) application security testing tools into the
      CI/CD pipeline to identify introduced injection flaws before production
      deployment.

  <h3>How to Prevent</h3>
  <div>
    <div>
      Preventing injection requires keeping data separate from commands and
      queries:
    </div>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The preferred option is to use a safe API, which avoids using the
          interpreter entirely, provides a parameterized interface, or migrates
          to Object Relational Mapping Tools (ORMs). Note: Even when
          parameterized, stored procedures can still introduce SQL injection if
          PL/SQL or T-SQL concatenates queries and data or executes hostile data
          with EXECUTE IMMEDIATE or exec().
        </li>
        <li>
          Use positive server-side input validation. This is not a complete
          defense as many applications require special characters, such as text
          areas or APIs for mobile applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          For any residual dynamic queries, escape special characters using the
          specific escape syntax for that interpreter. Note: SQL structures such
          as table names, column names, and so on cannot be escaped, and thus
          user-supplied structure names are dangerous. This is a common issue in
          report-writing software.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use LIMIT and other SQL controls within queries to prevent mass
          disclosure of records in case of SQL injection.
        </li>
      </ul>
