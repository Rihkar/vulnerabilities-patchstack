# Details of the assignment:
Create a simple SPA application, using Vue.js or a JavaScript framework based on Vue.js such as NuxtJS, that does the following:
- A page (default page) that shows a list of vulnerabilities (title, truncated description), you can copy vulnerabilities and their title, description and other information from https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/
- A page that allows you to view a specific vulnerability with the full description and any other information you copied from OWASP
- A page that allows you to modify a vulnerability
- A page that allows you to create a new vulnerability
# To keep in mind:
- You do not have to store anything in a remote database, nor do you have to communicate with an API, you can use local storage or store it in a store (VueX/Pinia). It's fine if those changes get lost on page reload for this task.
- You can use a pre-made template, or no template at all. It does not have to be fancy. We just want to see how you would implement this.
- No authorization and authentication implementation (login, signup, admin account) is required for this task, but you may do so if you want to.
# Result:
-  A page (default page) that shows a list of vulnerabilities - DONE
- A page that allows you to view a specific vulnerability with the full description and any other information you copied from OWASP -DONE
- A page that allows you to modify a vulnerability - LIMITED
- A page that allows you to create a new vulnerability - LIMITED
# Limitations:
- Navigation bar does re-route and rerender from the home page but not from 'specific vulnerability with the full description' page
- Editing list items is buggy. 
- Creating vulnerability with list items is buggy
